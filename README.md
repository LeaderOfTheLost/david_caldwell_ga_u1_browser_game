# Game Description

## Be first to move all of your dots to the other side of the board. While you are trying to move across the board you can send your opponents dots back to the start by landing on them and taking their place, putting them in Trouble.

## How to get started

- Each player has 3 dots that they will try to get to the opposite side of the board
- To decide who starts, roll the die, if Even - Red Starts, if Odd - Blue Starts

## Game Rules

- Lets say Red player rolls the die first
- Choose a dot to move, it will move the amount of spaces you rolled
- Blue players rolls and moves their dot
- If a player lands on a space with the opponents dot, the opponents dot is moved back to the start and the player takes over that position
- First to move all 3 dots to their opponents end of the board wins!!
